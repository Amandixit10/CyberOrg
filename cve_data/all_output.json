    "Synopsis": "The remote Apache Tomcat server is affected by multiple vulnerabilities",
    "Description": "The version of Tomcat installed on the remote host is prior to 9.0.31. It is, therefore, affected by multiple vulnerabilities as referenced in the fixed_in_apache_tomcat_9.0.31_security-9 advisory.- When using the Apache JServ Protocol (AJP), care must be taken when trusting incoming connections to     Apache Tomcat. Tomcat treats AJP connections as having higher trust than, for example, a similar HTTP     connection. If such connections are available to an attacker, they can be exploited in ways that may be     surprising. In Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.0.30, 8.5.0 to 8.5.50 and 7.0.0 to 7.0.99, Tomcat shipped     with an AJP Connector enabled by default that listened on all configured IP addresses. It was expected     (and recommended in the security guide) that this Connector would be disabled if not required. This     vulnerability report identified a mechanism that allowed: - returning arbitrary files from anywhere in the     web application - processing any file in the web application as a JSP Further, if the web application     allowed file upload and stored those files within the web application (or the attacker was able to control     the content of the web application by some other means) then this, along with the ability to process a     file as a JSP, made remote code execution possible. It is important to note that mitigation is only     required if an AJP port is accessible to untrusted users. Users wishing to take a defence-in-depth     approach and block the vector that permits returning arbitrary files and execution as JSP may upgrade to     Apache Tomcat 9.0.31, 8.5.51 or 7.0.100 or later. A number of changes were made to the default AJP     Connector configuration in 9.0.31 to harden the default configuration. It is likely that users upgrading     to 9.0.31, 8.5.51 or 7.0.100 or later will need to make small changes to their configurations.(CVE-2020-1938)- In Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.30, 8.5.0 to 8.5.50 and 7.0.0 to 7.0.99 the HTTP header parsing code used     an approach to end-of-line parsing that allowed some invalid HTTP headers to be parsed as valid. This led     to a possibility of HTTP Request Smuggling if Tomcat was located behind a reverse proxy that incorrectly     handled the invalid Transfer-Encoding header in a particular manner. Such a reverse proxy is considered     unlikely. (CVE-2020-1935)- The refactoring present in Apache Tomcat 9.0.28 to 9.0.30, 8.5.48 to 8.5.50 and 7.0.98 to 7.0.99     introduced a regression. The result of the regression was that invalid Transfer-Encoding headers were     incorrectly processed leading to a possibility of HTTP Request Smuggling if Tomcat was located behind a     reverse proxy that incorrectly handled the invalid Transfer-Encoding header in a particular manner. Such a     reverse proxy is considered unlikely. (CVE-2019-17569)Note that Nessus has not tested for these issues but has instead relied only on the application's self-reported version number.",

It is, therefore, affected by multiple vulnerabilities as referenced in the fixed_in_apache_tomcat_9.0.98_security-9 advisory.- Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition vulnerability during JSP compilation in Apache Tomcat     permits an RCE on case insensitive file systems when the default servlet is enabled for write (non-default     configuration).

Users running Tomcat on a case insensitive file     system with the default servlet write enabled (readonly initialisation parameter set to the non-default     value of false) may need additional configuration to fully mitigate CVE-2024-50379 depending on which     version of Java they are using with Tomcat: - running on Java 8 or Java 11: the system property     sun.io.useCanonCaches must be explicitly set to false (it defaults to true) - running on Java 17: the     system property sun.io.useCanonCaches, if set, must be set to false (it defaults to false) - running on     Java 21 onwards: no further configuration is required (the system property and the problematic cache have     been removed) Tomcat 11.0.3, 10.1.35 and 9.0.99 onwards will include checks that sun.io.useCanonCaches is     set appropriately before allowing the default servlet to be write enabled on a case insensitive file     system. Tomcat will also set sun.io.useCanonCaches to false by default where it can. (CVE-2024-56337)- Uncontrolled Resource Consumption vulnerability in the examples web application provided with Apache     Tomcat leads to denial of service.

It is, therefore, affected by a vulnerability as referenced in the release-9.8 advisory.- This release contains fixes for two security problems, one critical and one minor. 1) Race condition in     sshd(8) A critical vulnerability in sshd(8) was present in Portable OpenSSH versions between 8.5p1 and     9.7p1 (inclusive) that may allow arbitrary code execution with root privileges. Successful exploitation     has been demonstrated on 32-bit Linux/glibc systems with ASLR. Under lab conditions, the attack requires     on average 6-8 hours of continuous connections up to the maximum the server will accept. Exploitation on     64-bit systems is believed to be possible but has not been demonstrated at this time. It's likely that     these attacks will be improved upon. Exploitation on non-glibc systems is conceivable but has not been     examined. Systems that lack ASLR or users of downstream Linux distributions that have modified OpenSSH to     disable per-connection ASLR re-randomisation (yes - this is a thing, no - we don't understand why) may     potentially have an easier path to exploitation. OpenBSD is not vulnerable. We thank the Qualys Security     Advisory Team for discovering, reporting and demonstrating exploitability of this problem, and for     providing detailed feedback on additional mitigation measures. 2) Logic error in ssh(1)     ObscureKeystrokeTiming In OpenSSH version 9.5 through 9.7 (inclusive), when connected to an OpenSSH server     version 9.5 or later, a logic error in the ssh(1) ObscureKeystrokeTiming feature (on by default) rendered     this feature ineffective - a passive observer could still detect which network packets contained real     keystrokes when the countermeasure was active because both fake and real keystroke packets were being sent     unconditionally. This bug was Daniel Hugenroth and Alastair Beresford of the University of Cambridge     Computer Lab. Worse, the unconditional sending of both fake and real keystroke packets broke another long-     standing timing attack mitigation. Since OpenSSH 2.9.9 sshd(8) has sent fake keystoke echo packets for     traffic received on TTYs in echo-off mode, such as when entering a password into su(8) or sudo(8). This     bug rendered these fake keystroke echoes ineffective and could allow a passive observer of a SSH session     to once again detect when echo was off and obtain fairly limited timing information about keystrokes in     this situation (20ms granularity by default). This additional implication of the bug was identified by     Jacky Wei En Kung, Daniel Hugenroth and Alastair Beresford and we thank them for their detailed analysis.This bug does not affect connections when ObscureKeystrokeTiming was disabled or sessions where no TTY was     requested.

This attack allows a MITM to effect a limited break of     the integrity of the early encrypted SSH transport protocol by sending extra messages prior to the     commencement of encryption, and deleting an equal number of consecutive messages immediately after     encryption starts. A peer SSH client/server would not be able to detect that messages were deleted. While     cryptographically novel, the security impact of this attack is fortunately very limited as it only allows     deletion of consecutive messages, and deleting most messages at this stage of the protocol prevents user     user authentication from proceeding and results in a stuck connection. The most serious identified impact     is that it lets a MITM to delete the SSH2_MSG_EXT_INFO message sent before authentication starts, allowing     the attacker to disable a subset of the keystroke timing obfuscation features introduced in OpenSSH 9.5.There is no other discernable impact to session secrecy or session integrity. OpenSSH 9.6 addresses this     protocol weakness through a new strict KEX protocol extension that will be automatically enabled when     both the client and server support it. This extension makes two changes to the SSH transport protocol to     improve the integrity of the initial key exchange. Firstly, it requires endpoints to terminate the     connection if any unnecessary or unexpected message is received during key exchange (including messages     that were previously legal but not strictly required like SSH2_MSG_DEBUG). This removes most malleability     from the early protocol. Secondly, it resets the Message Authentication Code counter at the conclusion of     each key exchange, preventing previously inserted messages from being able to make persistent changes to     the sequence number across completion of a key exchange. Either of these changes should be sufficient to     thwart the Terrapin Attack. More details of these changes are in the PROTOCOL file in the OpenSSH source     distribition. (CVE-2023-48795)- ssh-agent(1): when adding PKCS#11-hosted private keys while specifying destination constraints, if the     PKCS#11 token returned multiple keys then only the first key had the constraints applied. Use of regular     private keys, FIDO tokens and unconstrained keys are unaffected. (CVE-2023-51384)- ssh(1): if an invalid user or hostname that contained shell metacharacters was passed to ssh(1), and a     ProxyCommand, LocalCommand directive or match exec predicate referenced the user or hostname via %u, %h     or similar expansion token, then an attacker who could supply arbitrary user/hostnames to ssh(1) could     potentially perform command injection depending on what quoting was present in the user-supplied     ssh_config(5) directive. This situation could arise in the case of git submodules, where a repository     could contain a submodule with shell characters in its user/hostname. Git does not ban shell     metacharacters in user or host names when checking out repositories from untrusted sources. Although we     believe it is the user's responsibility to ensure validity of arguments passed to ssh(1), especially     across a security boundary such as the git example above, OpenSSH 9.6 now bans most shell metacharacters     from user and hostnames supplied via the command-line. This countermeasure is not guaranteed to be     effective in all situations, as it is infeasible for ssh(1) to universally filter shell metacharacters     potentially relevant to user-supplied commands. User/hostnames provided via ssh_config(5) are not subject     to these restrictions, allowing configurations that use strange names to continue to be used, under the     assumption that the user knows what they are doing in their own configuration files. (CVE-2023-51385)Note that Nessus has not tested for these issues but has instead relied only on the application's self-reported version number.",
