[CVE-2020-27170]\n\n8) kernel/bpf/verifier.c has an off-by-one error (with a resultant integer underflow) affecting out-of-bounds speculation on pointer arithmetic, leading to side-channel attacks that defeat Spectre mitigations and obtain sensitive information from kernel memory. [CVE-2020-27171]\n\n9) A flaw was found in the JFS filesystem code. This flaw allows a local attacker with the ability to set extended attributes to panic the system, causing memory corruption or escalating privileges. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability. [CVE-2020-27815]\n\n10) An out-of-bounds (OOB) memory access flaw was found in x25_bind in net/x25/af_x25.c. A bounds check failure allows a local attacker with a user account on the system to gain access to out-of-bounds memory, leading to a system crash or a leak of internal kernel information.

[CVE-2020-36312]\n\n14) fuse_do_getattr() calls make_bad_inode() in inappropriate situations, causing a system crash. [CVE-2020-36322]\n\n15) A kernel pointer leak can be used to determine the address of the iscsi_transport structure. When an iSCSI transport is registered with the iSCSI subsystem, the transport&#39;s handle is available to unprivileged users via the sysfs file system, at /sys/class/iscsi_transport/$TRANSPORT_NAME/handle. When read, the show_transport_handle function (in drivers/scsi/scsi_transport_iscsi.c) is called, which leaks the handle. This handle is actually the pointer to an iscsi_transport struct in the kernel module&#39;s global variables. [CVE-2021-27363]\n\n16) drivers/scsi/scsi_transport_iscsi.c is adversely affected by the ability of an unprivileged user to craft Netlink messages. [CVE-2021-27364]\n\n17) Certain iSCSI data structures do not have appropriate length constraints or checks, and can exceed the PAGE_SIZE value. An unprivileged user can send a Netlink message that is associated with iSCSI, and has a length up to the maximum length of a Netlink message. [CVE-2021-27365]\n\n18) netback driver lacks necessary treatment of errors such as failed memory allocations (as a result of changes to the handling of grant mapping errors) [CVE-2021-28038]\n\n19) fastrpc_internal_invoke in drivers/misc/fastrpc.c does not prevent user applications from sending kernel RPC messages. [CVE-2021-28375]\n\n20) rtw_wx_set_scan driver allows writing beyond the end of the -&gt;ssid[] array. [CVE-2021-28660]\n\n21) The fix for XSA-365 includes initialization of pointers such that subsequent cleanup code wouldn&#39;t use uninitialized or stale values. This initialization went too far and may under certain conditions also overwrite pointers which are in need of cleaning up. The lack of cleanup would result in leaking persistent grants. The leak in turn would prevent fully cleaning up after a respective guest has died, leaving around zombie domains. All Linux versions having the fix for XSA-365 applied are vulnerable. XSA-365 was classified to affect versions back to at least 3.11. [CVE-2021-28688]\n\n22) A &quot;stall on CPU&quot; can occur because a retry loop continually finds the same bad inode [CVE-2021-28950]\n\n23) A race condition was discovered in get_old_root in fs/btrfs/ctree.c in the Linux kernel. It allows attackers to cause a denial of service (BUG) because of a lack of locking on an extent buffer before a cloning operation [CVE-2021-28964]\n\n24) In intel_pmu_drain_pebs_nhm in arch/x86/events/intel/ds.c in the Linux kernel on some Haswell CPUs, userspace applications (such as perf-fuzzer) can cause a system crash because the PEBS status in a PEBS record is mishandled. [CVE-2021-28971]\n\n25) In drivers/pci/hotplug/rpadlpar_sysfs.c in the Linux kernel, the RPA PCI Hotplug driver has a user-tolerable buffer overflow when writing a new device name to the driver from userspace, allowing userspace to write data to the kernel stack frame directly. This occurs because add_slot_store and remove_slot_store mishandle drc_name &#39;\\0&#39; termination. [CVE-2021-28972]\n\n26) BPF JIT compilers in the Linux kernel have incorrect computation of branch displacements, allowing them to execute arbitrary code within the kernel context. This affects arch/x86/net/bpf_jit_comp.c and arch/x86/net/bpf_jit_comp32.c. [CVE-2021-29154]\n\n27) drivers/net/ethernet/freescale/gianfar.c in the Freescale Gianfar Ethernet driver allows attackers to cause a system crash because a negative fragment size is calculated in situations involving an rx queue overrun when jumbo packets are used and NAPI is enabled. [CVE-2021-29264]\n\n28) usbip_sockfd_store in drivers/usb/usbip/stub_dev.c allows attackers to cause a denial of service (GPF) because the stub-up sequence has race conditions during an update of the local and shared status. [CVE-2021-29265]\n\n29) qrtr_recvmsg in net/qrtr/qrtr.c allows attackers to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory because of a partially uninitialized data structure. [CVE-2021-29647]\n\n30) An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel when a webcam device exists. video_usercopy in drivers/media/v4l2-core/v4l2-ioctl.c has a memory leak for large arguments. [CVE-2021-30002]\n\n31) A denial of service problem is identified if an extent tree is corrupted in a crafted ext4 filesystem in fs/ext4/extents.c in ext4_es_cache_extent.

A local attacker with the ability to load bpf programs could use this gain out-of-bounds reads in kernel memory leading to information disclosure (kernel memory), and possibly out-of-bounds writes that could potentially lead to code execution. [CVE-2021-3444]\n\n33) This issue allows a device to be inserted twice into a doubly-linked list, leading to a use-after-free when one of these devices is removed.

[CVE-2021-23991]\n\n2) Thunderbird did not check if the user ID associated with an OpenPGP key has a valid self signature. An attacker may create a crafted version of an OpenPGP key, by either replacing the original user ID, or by adding another user ID. If Thunderbird imports and accepts the crafted key, the Thunderbird user may falsely conclude that the false user ID belongs to the correspondent.

    "description": "BLS signature validation in lotus uses blst library method VerifyCompressed. This method accepts signatures in 2 forms: &quot;serialized&quot;, and &quot;compressed&quot;, meaning that BLS signatures can be provided as either of 2 unique byte arrays. Lotus block validation functions perform a uniqueness check on provided blocks. Two blocks are considered distinct if the CIDs of their blockheader do not match. The CID method for blockheader includes the BlockSig of the block. The result of these issues is that it would be possible to punish miners for valid blocks, as there are two different valid block CIDs available for each block, even though this must be unique. By switching from the go based &#39;blst&#39; bindings over to the bindings in &#39;filecoin-ffi&#39;, the code paths now ensure that all signatures are compressed by size and the way they are deserialized.

    "description": "OpenSSH 8.5 introduced the LogVerbose keyword. When this option was enabled with a set of patterns that activated logging in code that runs in the low-privilege sandboxed sshd process, the log messages were constructed in such a way that printf(3) format strings could effectively be specified in the low-privilege code. An attacker who had sucessfully exploited the low-privilege process could use this to escape OpenSSH&#39;s sandboxing and attack the high-privilege process. Exploitation of this weakness is highly unlikely in practice as the LogVerbose option is not enabled by default and is typically only used for debugging.

    "description": "1) The X509_V_FLAG_X509_STRICT flag enables additional security checks of the certificates present in a certificate chain. It is not set by default. In OpenSSL, a check to disallow certificates in the chain that have explicitly encoded elliptic curve parameters was added as an additional strict check. An error in the implementation of this check meant that the result of a previous check to confirm that certificates in the chain are valid CA certificates was overwritten. This effectively bypasses the check that non-CA certificates must not be able to issue other certificates. If a &quot;purpose&quot; has been configured then there is a subsequent opportunity for checks that the certificate is a valid CA. All of the named &quot;purpose&quot; values implemented in libcrypto perform this check. Therefore, where a purpose is set the certificate chain will still be rejected even when the strict flag has been used. A purpose is set by default in libssl client and server certificate verification routines, but it can be overridden or removed by an application. [CVE-2021-3450]\n\nMitigating factor: In order to be affected, an application must explicitly set the X509_V_FLAG_X509_STRICT verification flag and either not set a purpose for the certificate verification or, in the case of TLS client or server applications, override the default purpose.\n\n2) An OpenSSL TLS server may crash if sent a maliciously crafted renegotiation ClientHello message from a client. If a TLSv1.2 renegotiation ClientHello omits the signature_algorithms extension (where it was present in the initial ClientHello), but includes a signature_algorithms_cert extension then a NULL pointer dereference will result, leading to a crash and a denial of service attack.
