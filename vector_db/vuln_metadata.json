[CVE-2020-35519]\n\n11) arch/x86/kvm/svm/svm.c allows a set_memory_region_test infinite loop for certain nested page faults. [CVE-2020-36310]\n\n12) arch/x86/kvm/svm/sev.c allows attackers to cause a denial of service (soft lockup) by triggering destruction of a large SEV VM (which requires unregistering many encrypted regions). [CVE-2020-36311]\n\n13) virt/kvm/kvm_main.c has a kvm_io_bus_unregister_dev memory leak upon a kmalloc failure. [CVE-2020-36312]\n\n14) fuse_do_getattr() calls make_bad_inode() in inappropriate situations, causing a system crash. [CVE-2020-36322]\n\n15) A kernel pointer leak can be used to determine the address of the iscsi_transport structure. When an iSCSI transport is registered with the iSCSI subsystem, the transport&#39;s handle is available to unprivileged users via the sysfs file system, at /sys/class/iscsi_transport/$TRANSPORT_NAME/handle. When read, the show_transport_handle function (in drivers/scsi/scsi_transport_iscsi.c) is called, which leaks the handle. This handle is actually the pointer to an iscsi_transport struct in the kernel module&#39;s global variables. [CVE-2021-27363]\n\n16) drivers/scsi/scsi_transport_iscsi.c is adversely affected by the ability of an unprivileged user to craft Netlink messages. [CVE-2021-27364]\n\n17) Certain iSCSI data structures do not have appropriate length constraints or checks, and can exceed the PAGE_SIZE value. An unprivileged user can send a Netlink message that is associated with iSCSI, and has a length up to the maximum length of a Netlink message. [CVE-2021-27365]\n\n18) netback driver lacks necessary treatment of errors such as failed memory allocations (as a result of changes to the handling of grant mapping errors) [CVE-2021-28038]\n\n19) fastrpc_internal_invoke in drivers/misc/fastrpc.c does not prevent user applications from sending kernel RPC messages. [CVE-2021-28375]\n\n20) rtw_wx_set_scan driver allows writing beyond the end of the -&gt;ssid[] array. [CVE-2021-28660]\n\n21) The fix for XSA-365 includes initialization of pointers such that subsequent cleanup code wouldn&#39;t use uninitialized or stale values. This initialization went too far and may under certain conditions also overwrite pointers which are in need of cleaning up. The lack of cleanup would result in leaking persistent grants. The leak in turn would prevent fully cleaning up after a respective guest has died, leaving around zombie domains. All Linux versions having the fix for XSA-365 applied are vulnerable. XSA-365 was classified to affect versions back to at least 3.11. [CVE-2021-28688]\n\n22) A &quot;stall on CPU&quot; can occur because a retry loop continually finds the same bad inode [CVE-2021-28950]\n\n23) A race condition was discovered in get_old_root in fs/btrfs/ctree.c in the Linux kernel. It allows attackers to cause a denial of service (BUG) because of a lack of locking on an extent buffer before a cloning operation [CVE-2021-28964]\n\n24) In intel_pmu_drain_pebs_nhm in arch/x86/events/intel/ds.c in the Linux kernel on some Haswell CPUs, userspace applications (such as perf-fuzzer) can cause a system crash because the PEBS status in a PEBS record is mishandled. [CVE-2021-28971]\n\n25) In drivers/pci/hotplug/rpadlpar_sysfs.c in the Linux kernel, the RPA PCI Hotplug driver has a user-tolerable buffer overflow when writing a new device name to the driver from userspace, allowing userspace to write data to the kernel stack frame directly. This occurs because add_slot_store and remove_slot_store mishandle drc_name &#39;\\0&#39; termination. [CVE-2021-28972]\n\n26) BPF JIT compilers in the Linux kernel have incorrect computation of branch displacements, allowing them to execute arbitrary code within the kernel context. This affects arch/x86/net/bpf_jit_comp.c and arch/x86/net/bpf_jit_comp32.c. [CVE-2021-29154]\n\n27) drivers/net/ethernet/freescale/gianfar.c in the Freescale Gianfar Ethernet driver allows attackers to cause a system crash because a negative fragment size is calculated in situations involving an rx queue overrun when jumbo packets are used and NAPI is enabled. [CVE-2021-29264]\n\n28) usbip_sockfd_store in drivers/usb/usbip/stub_dev.c allows attackers to cause a denial of service (GPF) because the stub-up sequence has race conditions during an update of the local and shared status. [CVE-2021-29265]\n\n29) qrtr_recvmsg in net/qrtr/qrtr.c allows attackers to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory because of a partially uninitialized data structure. [CVE-2021-29647]\n\n30) An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel when a webcam device exists. video_usercopy in drivers/media/v4l2-core/v4l2-ioctl.c has a memory leak for large arguments. [CVE-2021-30002]\n\n31) A denial of service problem is identified if an extent tree is corrupted in a crafted ext4 filesystem in fs/ext4/extents.c in ext4_es_cache_extent. Fabricating an integer overflow. [CVE-2021-3428]\n\n32) The bpf verifier in the Linux kernel did not properly handle mod32 destination register truncation when the source register was known to be 0. A local attacker with the ability to load bpf programs could use this gain out-of-bounds reads in kernel memory leading to information disclosure (kernel memory), and possibly out-of-bounds writes that could potentially lead to code execution. [CVE-2021-3444]\n\n33) This issue allows a device to be inserted twice into a doubly-linked list, leading to a use-after-free when one of these devices is removed.

When this option was enabled with a set of patterns that activated logging in code that runs in the low-privilege sandboxed sshd process, the log messages were constructed in such a way that printf(3) format strings could effectively be specified in the low-privilege code. An attacker who had sucessfully exploited the low-privilege process could use this to escape OpenSSH&#39;s sandboxing and attack the high-privilege process. Exploitation of this weakness is highly unlikely in practice as the LogVerbose option is not enabled by default and is typically only used for debugging.

    "description": "1) The X509_V_FLAG_X509_STRICT flag enables additional security checks of the certificates present in a certificate chain. It is not set by default. In OpenSSL, a check to disallow certificates in the chain that have explicitly encoded elliptic curve parameters was added as an additional strict check. An error in the implementation of this check meant that the result of a previous check to confirm that certificates in the chain are valid CA certificates was overwritten. This effectively bypasses the check that non-CA certificates must not be able to issue other certificates. If a &quot;purpose&quot; has been configured then there is a subsequent opportunity for checks that the certificate is a valid CA. All of the named &quot;purpose&quot; values implemented in libcrypto perform this check. Therefore, where a purpose is set the certificate chain will still be rejected even when the strict flag has been used. A purpose is set by default in libssl client and server certificate verification routines, but it can be overridden or removed by an application. [CVE-2021-3450]\n\nMitigating factor: In order to be affected, an application must explicitly set the X509_V_FLAG_X509_STRICT verification flag and either not set a purpose for the certificate verification or, in the case of TLS client or server applications, override the default purpose.\n\n2) An OpenSSL TLS server may crash if sent a maliciously crafted renegotiation ClientHello message from a client. If a TLSv1.2 renegotiation ClientHello omits the signature_algorithms extension (where it was present in the initial ClientHello), but includes a signature_algorithms_cert extension then a NULL pointer dereference will result, leading to a crash and a denial of service attack.

This affects pointer types that do not define a ptr_limit. [CVE-2020-27170]\n\n8) kernel/bpf/verifier.c has an off-by-one error (with a resultant integer underflow) affecting out-of-bounds speculation on pointer arithmetic, leading to side-channel attacks that defeat Spectre mitigations and obtain sensitive information from kernel memory. [CVE-2020-27171]\n\n9) A flaw was found in the JFS filesystem code. This flaw allows a local attacker with the ability to set extended attributes to panic the system, causing memory corruption or escalating privileges. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability. [CVE-2020-27815]\n\n10) An out-of-bounds (OOB) memory access flaw was found in x25_bind in net/x25/af_x25.c. A bounds check failure allows a local attacker with a user account on the system to gain access to out-of-bounds memory, leading to a system crash or a leak of internal kernel information. [CVE-2020-35519]\n\n11) arch/x86/kvm/svm/svm.c allows a set_memory_region_test infinite loop for certain nested page faults. [CVE-2020-36310]\n\n12) arch/x86/kvm/svm/sev.c allows attackers to cause a denial of service (soft lockup) by triggering destruction of a large SEV VM (which requires unregistering many encrypted regions). [CVE-2020-36311]\n\n13) virt/kvm/kvm_main.c has a kvm_io_bus_unregister_dev memory leak upon a kmalloc failure. [CVE-2020-36312]\n\n14) fuse_do_getattr() calls make_bad_inode() in inappropriate situations, causing a system crash. [CVE-2020-36322]\n\n15) A kernel pointer leak can be used to determine the address of the iscsi_transport structure. When an iSCSI transport is registered with the iSCSI subsystem, the transport&#39;s handle is available to unprivileged users via the sysfs file system, at /sys/class/iscsi_transport/$TRANSPORT_NAME/handle. When read, the show_transport_handle function (in drivers/scsi/scsi_transport_iscsi.c) is called, which leaks the handle. This handle is actually the pointer to an iscsi_transport struct in the kernel module&#39;s global variables. [CVE-2021-27363]\n\n16) drivers/scsi/scsi_transport_iscsi.c is adversely affected by the ability of an unprivileged user to craft Netlink messages. [CVE-2021-27364]\n\n17) Certain iSCSI data structures do not have appropriate length constraints or checks, and can exceed the PAGE_SIZE value. An unprivileged user can send a Netlink message that is associated with iSCSI, and has a length up to the maximum length of a Netlink message. [CVE-2021-27365]\n\n18) netback driver lacks necessary treatment of errors such as failed memory allocations (as a result of changes to the handling of grant mapping errors) [CVE-2021-28038]\n\n19) fastrpc_internal_invoke in drivers/misc/fastrpc.c does not prevent user applications from sending kernel RPC messages. [CVE-2021-28375]\n\n20) rtw_wx_set_scan driver allows writing beyond the end of the -&gt;ssid[] array. [CVE-2021-28660]\n\n21) The fix for XSA-365 includes initialization of pointers such that subsequent cleanup code wouldn&#39;t use uninitialized or stale values. This initialization went too far and may under certain conditions also overwrite pointers which are in need of cleaning up. The lack of cleanup would result in leaking persistent grants. The leak in turn would prevent fully cleaning up after a respective guest has died, leaving around zombie domains. All Linux versions having the fix for XSA-365 applied are vulnerable. XSA-365 was classified to affect versions back to at least 3.11. [CVE-2021-28688]\n\n22) A &quot;stall on CPU&quot; can occur because a retry loop continually finds the same bad inode [CVE-2021-28950]\n\n23) A race condition was discovered in get_old_root in fs/btrfs/ctree.c in the Linux kernel. It allows attackers to cause a denial of service (BUG) because of a lack of locking on an extent buffer before a cloning operation [CVE-2021-28964]\n\n24) In intel_pmu_drain_pebs_nhm in arch/x86/events/intel/ds.c in the Linux kernel on some Haswell CPUs, userspace applications (such as perf-fuzzer) can cause a system crash because the PEBS status in a PEBS record is mishandled. [CVE-2021-28971]\n\n25) In drivers/pci/hotplug/rpadlpar_sysfs.c in the Linux kernel, the RPA PCI Hotplug driver has a user-tolerable buffer overflow when writing a new device name to the driver from userspace, allowing userspace to write data to the kernel stack frame directly. This occurs because add_slot_store and remove_slot_store mishandle drc_name &#39;\\0&#39; termination. [CVE-2021-28972]\n\n26) BPF JIT compilers in the Linux kernel have incorrect computation of branch displacements, allowing them to execute arbitrary code within the kernel context. This affects arch/x86/net/bpf_jit_comp.c and arch/x86/net/bpf_jit_comp32.c. [CVE-2021-29154]\n\n27) drivers/net/ethernet/freescale/gianfar.c in the Freescale Gianfar Ethernet driver allows attackers to cause a system crash because a negative fragment size is calculated in situations involving an rx queue overrun when jumbo packets are used and NAPI is enabled. [CVE-2021-29264]\n\n28) usbip_sockfd_store in drivers/usb/usbip/stub_dev.c allows attackers to cause a denial of service (GPF) because the stub-up sequence has race conditions during an update of the local and shared status. [CVE-2021-29265]\n\n29) qrtr_recvmsg in net/qrtr/qrtr.c allows attackers to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory because of a partially uninitialized data structure. [CVE-2021-29647]\n\n30) An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel when a webcam device exists. video_usercopy in drivers/media/v4l2-core/v4l2-ioctl.c has a memory leak for large arguments. [CVE-2021-30002]\n\n31) A denial of service problem is identified if an extent tree is corrupted in a crafted ext4 filesystem in fs/ext4/extents.c in ext4_es_cache_extent. Fabricating an integer overflow. [CVE-2021-3428]\n\n32) The bpf verifier in the Linux kernel did not properly handle mod32 destination register truncation when the source register was known to be 0. A local attacker with the ability to load bpf programs could use this gain out-of-bounds reads in kernel memory leading to information disclosure (kernel memory), and possibly out-of-bounds writes that could potentially lead to code execution. [CVE-2021-3444]\n\n33) This issue allows a device to be inserted twice into a doubly-linked list, leading to a use-after-free when one of these devices is removed.

    "description": "OpenSSH 8.5 introduced the LogVerbose keyword. When this option was enabled with a set of patterns that activated logging in code that runs in the low-privilege sandboxed sshd process, the log messages were constructed in such a way that printf(3) format strings could effectively be specified in the low-privilege code. An attacker who had sucessfully exploited the low-privilege process could use this to escape OpenSSH&#39;s sandboxing and attack the high-privilege process. Exploitation of this weakness is highly unlikely in practice as the LogVerbose option is not enabled by default and is typically only used for debugging. No vulnerabilities in the low-privilege process are currently known to exist.\n\nVendor Affected Components:\nOpenSSH 8.5",

    "description": "1) The X509_V_FLAG_X509_STRICT flag enables additional security checks of the certificates present in a certificate chain. It is not set by default. In OpenSSL, a check to disallow certificates in the chain that have explicitly encoded elliptic curve parameters was added as an additional strict check. An error in the implementation of this check meant that the result of a previous check to confirm that certificates in the chain are valid CA certificates was overwritten. This effectively bypasses the check that non-CA certificates must not be able to issue other certificates. If a &quot;purpose&quot; has been configured then there is a subsequent opportunity for checks that the certificate is a valid CA. All of the named &quot;purpose&quot; values implemented in libcrypto perform this check. Therefore, where a purpose is set the certificate chain will still be rejected even when the strict flag has been used. A purpose is set by default in libssl client and server certificate verification routines, but it can be overridden or removed by an application. [CVE-2021-3450]\n\nMitigating factor: In order to be affected, an application must explicitly set the X509_V_FLAG_X509_STRICT verification flag and either not set a purpose for the certificate verification or, in the case of TLS client or server applications, override the default purpose.\n\n2) An OpenSSL TLS server may crash if sent a maliciously crafted renegotiation ClientHello message from a client. If a TLSv1.2 renegotiation ClientHello omits the signature_algorithms extension (where it was present in the initial ClientHello), but includes a signature_algorithms_cert extension then a NULL pointer dereference will result, leading to a crash and a denial of service attack. [CVE-2021-3449]\n\nMitigating factor: A server is only vulnerable if it has TLSv1.2 and renegotiation enabled (which is the default configuration).

[CVE-2021-21547]\n\nThe following vulnerabilities in third-party components were addressed:\n\n2) Apache-Tomcat: The SSI printenv command echoes user provided data without escaping and is, therefore, vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS). [CVE-2019-0221]\n\nMitigating Factor: SSI is disabled by default. The printenv command is intended for debugging and is unlikely to be present in a production website.\n\n3) Apache-Tomcat: When running on Windows with enableCmdLineArguments enabled, the CGI Servlet is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution due to a bug in the way the JRE passes command line arguments to Windows. [CVE-2019-0232]\n\n4) Apache-Tomcat: The HTTP header parsing code used an approach to end-of-line (EOL) parsing that allowed some invalid HTTP headers to be parsed as valid. This led to a possibility of HTTP Request Smuggling if Tomcat was located behind a reverse proxy that incorrectly handled the invalid Transfer-Encoding header in a particular manner. Such a reverse proxy is considered unlikely. [CVE-2020-1935]\n\n5) Apache-Tomcat: When using the Apache JServ Protocol (AJP), care must be taken when trusting incoming connections to Apache Tomcat. Tomcat treats AJP connections as having higher trust than, for example, a similar HTTP connection. If such connections are available to an attacker, they can be exploited in ways that may be surprising. Prior versions of Tomcat shipped with an AJP Connector enabled by default that listened on all configured IP addresses. It was expected (and recommended in the security guide) that this Connector would be disabled if not required. Further, if the web application allowed file upload and stored those files within the web application (or the attacker was able to control the content of the web application by some other means) then this, along with the ability to process a file as a JSP, made remote code execution possible. It is important to note that mitigation is only required if an AJP port is accessible to untrusted users. [CVE-2020-1938]\n\n6) Apache-Tomcat: A specifically crafted request allows an attacker to be able to trigger remote code execution via deserialization of the file under their control. [CVE-2020-9484]\n\nMitigating Factor: All of the following conditions must be true for the attack to succeed:\n\u2022 An attacker is able to control the contents and name of a file on the server.\n\u2022 The server is configured to use the PersistenceManager with a FileStore.\n\u2022 The PersistenceManager is configured with sessionAttributeValueClassNameFilter=&quot;null&quot; (the default unless a SecurityManager is used) or a sufficiently lax filter to allow the attacker provided object to be deserialized.\n\u2022 The attacker knows the relative file path from the storage location used by FileStore to the file the attacker has control over.\n\n7) Apache-Tomcat: When Tomcat is configured with the JMX Remote Lifecycle Listener, a local attacker without access to the Tomcat process or configuration files is able to manipulate the RMI registry to perform a man-in-the-middle attack to capture user names and passwords used to access the JMX interface. The attacker can then use these credentials to access the JMX interface and gain complete control over the Tomcat instance. [CVE-2019-12418]\n\n8) Apache-Tomcat: The payload length in a WebSocket frame was not correctly validated. Invalid payload lengths could trigger an infinite loop. Multiple requests with invalid payload lengths could lead to a denial of service. [CVE-2020-13935]\n\n9) Apache-Tomcat: When using FORM authentication there was a narrow window where an attacker could perform a session fixation attack. [CVE-2019-17563]\n\n10) Apache-Tomcat: A previous refactoring introduced a regression. The result of the regression was that invalid Transfer-Encoding headers were incorrectly processed leading to a possibility of HTTP Request Smuggling if Tomcat was located behind a reverse proxy that incorrectly handled the invalid Transfer-Encoding header in a particular manner. Such a reverse proxy is considered unlikely. [CVE-2019-17569]\n\n11) Oracle Java SE: Vulnerability in the Java SE, Java SE Embedded product of Oracle Java SE (component: Serialization).

This vulnerability does not apply to Java deployments, typically in servers, that load and run only trusted code (e.g., code installed by an administrator). [CVE-2020-14796]\n\n16) Oracle Java SE: Vulnerability in the Java SE, Java SE Embedded product of Oracle Java SE (component: Libraries). Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise Java SE, Java SE Embedded. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some of Java SE, Java SE Embedded accessible data. Applies to client and server deployment of Java. This vulnerability can be exploited through sandboxed Java Web Start applications and sandboxed Java applets. It can also be exploited by supplying data to APIs in the specified Component without using sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets, such as through a web service. [CVE-2020-14797]\n\n17) Oracle Java SE: Vulnerability in the Java SE, Java SE Embedded product of Oracle Java SE (component: Libraries).

Easily exploitable vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise Java SE. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized read access to a subset of Java SE accessible data. This vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets, that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability does not apply to Java deployments, typically in servers, that load and run only trusted code (e.g., code installed by an administrator). [CVE-2020-14803]\n\n19) Apache2: Apache HTTP Server redirects configured with mod_rewrite that were intended to be self-referential might be fooled by encoded newlines and redirect instead to an an unexpected URL within the request URL. [CVE-2020-1927]\n\n20) Apache2: A vulnerability in Apache&#39;s HTTP server (httpd) allows the mod_proxy_ftp module to use uninitialized memory with proxying to a malicious FTP server. [CVE-2020-1934]\n\n21) Apache2: When using the Apache JServ Protocol (AJP), care must be taken when trusting incoming connections to Apache Tomcat. Tomcat treats AJP connections as having higher trust than, for example, a similar HTTP connection. If such connections are available to an attacker, they can be exploited in ways that may be surprising. Prior versions of Tomcat shipped with an AJP Connector enabled by default that listened on all configured IP addresses. It was expected (and recommended in the security guide) that this Connector would be disabled if not required. Further, if the web application allowed file upload and stored those files within the web application (or the attacker was able to control the content of the web application by some other means) then this, along with the ability to process a file as a JSP, made remote code execution possible. [CVE-2020-1938]\n\n22) Python: The AbstractBasicAuthHandler class of the urllib.request module uses an inefficient regular expression (catastrophic backtracking) which can be exploited by an attacker to cause a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS). [CVE-2020-8492]\n\n23) Python: A ZIP bomb attack was found in the Python zipfile module. A remote attacker could abuse this vulnerability by providing a specially crafted ZIP file that, when decompressed by zipfile, would exhaust system resources resulting in a denial of service. [CVE-2019-9674]\n\n24) Python: A CRLF injection vulnerability was discovered in python in the way URLs are handled when doing an HTTP/HTTPS connection (e.g. through urlopen() or HTTPConnection). An attacker who can control the url parameter passed to urlopen method in the urllib/urllib2 modules can inject CRLF sequences and HTTP headers by abusing the &quot;host&quot; part of the URL. Control characters in hostnames in http.client are now disallowed. Such potentially malicious header injection URLs now cause an InvalidURL to be raised.

    "description": "1) The X509_V_FLAG_X509_STRICT flag enables additional security checks of the certificates present in a certificate chain. It is not set by default. In OpenSSL, a check to disallow certificates in the chain that have explicitly encoded elliptic curve parameters was added as an additional strict check. An error in the implementation of this check meant that the result of a previous check to confirm that certificates in the chain are valid CA certificates was overwritten. This effectively bypasses the check that non-CA certificates must not be able to issue other certificates. If a &quot;purpose&quot; has been configured then there is a subsequent opportunity for checks that the certificate is a valid CA. All of the named &quot;purpose&quot; values implemented in libcrypto perform this check. Therefore, where a purpose is set the certificate chain will still be rejected even when the strict flag has been used. A purpose is set by default in libssl client and server certificate verification routines, but it can be overridden or removed by an application. [CVE-2021-3450]\n\n2) A TLS server may crash if sent a maliciously crafted renegotiation ClientHello message from a client. If a TLSv1.2 renegotiation ClientHello omits the signature_algorithms extension (where it was present in the initial ClientHello), but includes a signature_algorithms_cert extension then a NULL pointer dereference will result, leading to a crash and a denial of service attack. [CVE-2021-3449]\n\n3) The public API function X509_issuer_and_serial_hash() attempts to create a unique hash value based on the issuer and serial number data contained within an X509 certificate. However it fails to correctly handle any errors that may occur while parsing the issuer field (which might occur if the issuer field is maliciously constructed). This may subsequently result in a NULL pointer deref and a crash leading to a potential denial of service attack. The function X509_issuer_and_serial_hash() is never directly called by OpenSSL itself so applications are only vulnerable if they use this function directly and they use it on certificates that may have been obtained from untrusted sources. [CVE-2021-23841]\n\n4) OpenSSL could provide weaker than expected security, caused by incorrect SSLv2 rollback protection that allows for the inversion of the logic during a padding check. If the server is configured for SSLv2 support at compile time, configured for SSLv2 support at runtime or configured for SSLv2 ciphersuites, it will accept a connection if a version rollback attack has occurred and erroneously reject a connection if a normal SSLv2 connection attempt is made. [CVE-2021-23839]\n\n5) Calls to EVP_CipherUpdate, EVP_EncryptUpdate and EVP_DecryptUpdate may overflow the output length argument in some cases where the input length is close to the maximum permissable length for an integer on the platform. In such cases the return value from the function call will be 1 (indicating success), but the output length value will be negative. This could cause applications to behave incorrectly or crash. [CVE-2021-23840]\n\n6) Fixed SRP_Calc_client_key so that it runs in constant time. The previous implementation called BN_mod_exp without setting BN_FLG_CONSTTIME. This could be exploited in a side channel attack to recover the password. Since the attack is local host only this is outside of the current OpenSSL threat model and therefore no CVE is assigned. \n\nVendor Affected Components:\nMySQL Community Server 5.7.x \u2264 5.7.33\nMySQL Community Server 8.0.x \u2264 8.0.23",

    "solution": "Update Meinberg LANTIME Firmware to version 6.24.028, 7.02.003 or later.",
    "impact": "Exposure of Sensitive Information, Manipulation of Data, Denial of Service (DoS)",
    "description": "Meinberg LANTIME firmware was updated to include updates of OpenSSL, sudo and Meinberg LTOS web interface to fix the following vulnerabilities:\n\n1) The X509_V_FLAG_X509_STRICT flag enables additional security checks of the certificates present in a certificate chain. It is not set by default. A check to disallow certificates in the chain that have explicitly encoded elliptic curve parameters was added as an additional strict check. An error in the implementation of this check meant that the result of a previous check to confirm that certificates in the chain are valid CA certificates was overwritten. This effectively bypasses the check that non-CA certificates must not be able to issue other certificates. If a &quot;purpose&quot; has been configured then there is a subsequent opportunity for checks that the certificate is a valid CA. All of the named &quot;purpose&quot; values implemented in libcrypto perform this check. Therefore, where a purpose is set the certificate chain will still be rejected even when the strict flag has been used. A purpose is set by default in libssl client and server certificate verification routines, but it can be overridden or removed by an application. [CVE-2021-3450]\n\n2) In OpenSSL, calls to EVP_CipherUpdate, EVP_EncryptUpdate and EVP_DecryptUpdate may overflow the output length argument in some cases where the input length is close to the maximum permissable length for an integer on the platform. In such cases the return value from the function call will be 1 (indicating success), but the output length value will be negative. This could cause applications to behave incorrectly or crash. [CVE-2021-23840]\n\n3) The OpenSSL public API function X509_issuer_and_serial_hash() attempts to create a unique hash value based on the issuer and serial number data contained within an X509 certificate. However it fails to correctly handle any errors that may occur while parsing the issuer field (which might occur if the issuer field is maliciously constructed). This may subsequently result in a NULL pointer deref and a crash leading to a potential denial of service attack. [CVE-2021-23841]\n\n4) An OpenSSL TLS server may crash if sent a maliciously crafted renegotiation ClientHello message from a client. If a TLSv1.2 renegotiation ClientHello omits the signature_algorithms extension (where it was present in the initial ClientHello), but includes a signature_algorithms_cert extension then a NULL pointer dereference will result, leading to a crash and a denial of service attack. [CVE-2021-3449]\n\n5) A heap-based buffer overflow is present in the way sudo parses command line arguments. This vulnerability is exploitable by any local user who can execute the sudo command (by default, any local user can execute sudo) without authentication. Successful exploitation could lead to privilege escalation. [CVE-2021-3156]\n\n6) In LTOS-Web-Interface due to missing input validation of a few fields in the SyncMon web interface, the LTOS was susceptible for Cross-Site-Scripting (XSS) and Command-Line-Injection attacks.\n\nVendor Affected Components:\nMeinberg LANTIME Firmware \u2264 6.24.027\nMeinberg LANTIME Firmware \u2264 7.02.002",

OpenSSL supports Intel&#39;s RDRAND instruction; on processors without this instruction (Intel before 3rd generation Ivy Bridge in 2012 and AMD before 2015) our initialization looked for rdrand.dll in an unprotected directory. If the path accessed to find rdrand.dll does not exist, a regular user might be able to create the non-privileged path and create their own DLL. Control over a DLL loaded into OpenSSL could allow them to inject code to be run by the account running Cerberus FTP Server at the next reload. In addition, our Windows code tried to access a non-existent unprotected source to help seed the PNRG. However, even if this source were compromised with known data, it would not compromise the overall PNRG initialization.

[CVE-2019-19060]\n\n2) A bypass was found for the Spectre v1 hardening in the eBPF engine of the Linux kernel. The code in the kernel/bpf/verifier.c performs undesirable out-of-bounds speculation on pointer arithmetic in various cases, including cases of different branches with different state or limits to sanitize, leading to side-channel attacks. [CVE-2019-7308]\n\n3) A refcount leak in llcp_sock_bind() causing use-after-free which might lead to privilege escalations. [CVE-2020-25670]\n\n4) A refcount leak in llcp_sock_connect() causing use-after-free which might lead to privilege escalations. [CVE-2020-25671]\n\n5) The llcp_sock_connect contains a memory leak vulnerability. [CVE-2020-25672]\n\n6) By default accessing the eBPF verifier (in the Linux kernels eBPF verification code) is only accessible to privileged users with CAP_SYS_ADMIN. A vulnerability that triggers Integer underflow when restricting speculative pointer arithmetic allows unprivileged local users to leak the content of kernel memory. [CVE-2020-27171]\n\n7) The rtw_wx_set_scan driver allows writing beyond the end of the -&gt;ssid[] array. [CVE-2021-28660]\n\n8) The fix for XSA-365 includes initialization of pointers such that subsequent cleanup code wouldn&#39;t use uninitialized or stale values. This initialization went too far and may under certain conditions also overwrite pointers which are in need of cleaning up. The lack of cleanup would result in leaking persistent grants. The leak in turn would prevent fully cleaning up after a respective guest has died, leaving around zombie domains. [CVE-2021-28688]\n\n9) A race condition vulnerability was found in get_old_root in fs/btrfs/ctree.c in the btrfs file-system allowing a local attacker with a special user privilege to cause a denial of service due to not locking an extent buffer before a cloning operation. [CVE-2021-28964]\n\n10) A vulnerability in the Linux kernels implementation of the RPA PCI Hotplug driver for power-pc. A user with permissions to write to the sysfs settings for this driver can trigger a buffer overflow when writing a new device name to the driver from userspace, overwriting data in the kernel&#39;s stack. [CVE-2021-28972]\n\n11) By default, accessing the eBPF verifier (in the Linux kernels eBPF implementation) is only accessible to privileged users with CAP_SYS_ADMIN. A local user with the ability to insert eBPF instructions can abuse a flaw in eBPF to corrupt memory. [CVE-2021-29154]\n\n12) The usbip driver allows attackers to cause a denial of service (GPF) because the stub-up sequence has race conditions during an update of the local and shared status.

    "description": "1) The implementation of ProcessBuilder in the Libraries component of OpenJDK on the Windows platform did not properly detect command arguments that were not quoted correctly. This could lead to manipulation of command arguments when executing processes with arguments from untrusted sources. [CVE-2021-2161]\n\n2) In the Libraries component of OpenJDK enforced constraints defined in the jdk.jar.disabledAlgorithms security property, the verification of a JAR file signed using a disabled algorithm could succeed in certain cases, leading to bypass of the intended security restrictions. [CVE-2021-2163]\n\n3) The public API function X509_issuer_and_serial_hash() attempts to create a unique hash value based on the issuer and serial number data contained within an X509 certificate. However it fails to correctly handle any errors that may occur while parsing the issuer field (which might occur if the issuer field is maliciously constructed). This may subsequently result in a NULL pointer deref and a crash leading to a potential denial of service attack. The function X509_issuer_and_serial_hash() is never directly called by OpenSSL itself so applications are only vulnerable if they use this function directly and they use it on certificates that may have been obtained from untrusted sources. [CVE-2021-23841]\n\n4) The X509_V_FLAG_X509_STRICT flag enables additional security checks of the certificates present in a certificate chain. It is not set by default. In OpenSSL, a check to disallow certificates in the chain that have explicitly encoded elliptic curve parameters was added as an additional strict check. An error in the implementation of this check meant that the result of a previous check to confirm that certificates in the chain are valid CA certificates was overwritten. This effectively bypasses the check that non-CA certificates must not be able to issue other certificates. If a &quot;purpose&quot; has been configured then there is a subsequent opportunity for checks that the certificate is a valid CA. All of the named &quot;purpose&quot; values implemented in libcrypto perform this check. Therefore, where a purpose is set the certificate chain will still be rejected even when the strict flag has been used. A purpose is set by default in libssl client and server certificate verification routines, but it can be overridden or removed by an application.

[CVE-2020-11947]\n\n2) In QEMU, an integer overflow was found in the SM501 display driver implementation. This flaw occurs in the COPY_AREA macro while handling MMIO write operations through the sm501_2d_engine_write() callback. A local attacker could abuse this flaw to crash the QEMU process in sm501_2d_operation() in hw/display/sm501.c on the host, resulting in a denial of service. [CVE-2020-12829]\n\n3) In QEMU, es1370_transfer_audio in hw/audio/es1370.c does not properly validate the frame count, which allows guest OS users to trigger an out-of-bounds access during an es1370_write() operation. [CVE-2020-13361]\n\n4) In QEMU, megasas_lookup_frame in hw/scsi/megasas.c has an out-of-bounds read via a crafted reply_queue_head field from a guest OS user.

[CVE-2020-13765]\n\n7) An out-of-bounds read/write access flaw was found in the USB emulator of the QEMU. This issue occurs while processing USB packets from a guest when USBDevice &#39;setup_len&#39; exceeds its &#39;data_buf[4096]&#39; in the do_token_in, do_token_out routines. This flaw allows a guest user to crash the QEMU process, resulting in a denial of service, or the potential execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the QEMU process on the host. [CVE-2020-14364]\n\n8) In QEMU, a MemoryRegionOps object may lack read/write callback methods, leading to a NULL pointer dereference. [CVE-2020-15469]\n\n9) hw/net/xgmac.c in the XGMAC Ethernet controller in QEMU has a buffer overflow. This occurs during packet transmission and affects the highbank and midway emulated machines.

It could occur while processing USB requests due to missing handling of DMA memory map failure. A malicious privileged user within the guest may abuse this flaw to send bogus USB requests and crash the QEMU process on the host, resulting in a denial of service. [CVE-2020-25723]\n\n15) eth_get_gso_type in net/eth.c in QEMU allows guest OS users to trigger an assertion failure. A guest can crash the QEMU process via packet data that lacks a valid Layer 3 protocol. [CVE-2020-27617]\n\n16) slirp.c in libslirp has a buffer over-read because it tries to read a certain amount of header data even if that exceeds the total packet length. [CVE-2020-29130]\n\n17) ide_atapi_cmd_reply_end in hw/ide/atapi.c in QEMU allows out-of-bounds read access because a buffer index is not validated. [CVE-2020-29443]\n\n18) A race condition flaw was found in the 9pfs server implementation of QEMU. This flaw allows a malicious 9p client to cause a use-after-free error, potentially escalating their privileges on the system. [CVE-2021-20181]\n\n19) An integer overflow issue was found in the vmxnet3 NIC emulator of the QEMU. It may occur if a guest was to supply invalid values for rx/tx queue size or other NIC parameters. A privileged guest user may use this flaw to crash the QEMU process on the host resulting in DoS scenario. [CVE-2021-20203]\n\n20) An infinite loop flaw was found in the e1000 NIC emulator of the QEMU. This issue occurs while processing transmits (tx) descriptors in process_tx_desc if various descriptor fields are initialized with invalid values. This flaw allows a guest to consume CPU cycles on the host, resulting in a denial of service. [CVE-2021-20257]\n\n21) A potential stack overflow via infinite loop issue was found in various NIC emulators of QEMU. The issue occurs in loopback mode of a NIC wherein reentrant DMA checks get bypassed. A guest user/process may use this flaw to consume CPU cycles or crash the QEMU process on the host resulting in DoS scenario.

    "description": "1) A NULL pointer dereference occurs for certain accesses to the SynIC Hyper-V context. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability. [CVE-2021-30178]\n\n2) Dell has released a security patch that contains a set of security updates for multiple vulnerabilities that may potentially be exploited by malicious users to compromise the affected system. [CVE-2021-3659]\n\n3) A vulnerability in the fs/inode.c:inode_init_owner() function logic of the Linux kernel that allows local users to create files for the XFS file-system with an unintended group ownership and with group execution and SGID permission bits set, in a scenario where a directory is SGID and belongs to a certain group and is writable by a user who is not a member of this group. This can lead to excessive permissions granted in case when they should not. [CVE-2021-4037]\n\n4) Elevation of privilege in io_uring. [CVE-2022-20424]\n\n5) Elevation of privilege. [CVE-2022-20409]\n\n6) A use-after-free exists in io_sqpoll_wait_sq in fs/io_uring.c allows an attacker to crash the kernel, resulting in denial of service where finish_wait can be skipped. An attack can occur in some situations by forking a process and then quickly terminating it. [CVE-2022-47946]\n\n7) A out of bounds memory write in the Linux kernel HID subsystem in the way user attach USB or other HID device that generates incorrect data inside HID report field. A local user could use this vulnerability to crash the system or possibly escalate their privileges on the system. [CVE-2021-0512]\n\n8) Elevation of Privilege. [CVE-2021-0937]\n\n9) In bpf_skb_change_head of filter.c, there is a possible out of bounds read due to a use after free. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with System execution privileges needed. [CVE-2021-0941]\n\n10) A heap out-of-bounds write affecting Linux was discovered in net/netfilter/x_tables.c. This allows an attacker to gain privileges or cause a DoS (via heap memory corruption) through user name space. This vulnerability may allow an attacker to gain improper privileges or cause a degradation of system performance that can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS). [CVE-2021-22555]\n\n11) To service requests to the PV backend, the driver maps grant references provided by the frontend. In this process, errors may be encountered. In one case, an error encountered earlier might be discarded by later processing, resulting in the caller assuming successful mapping, and hence subsequent operations trying to access space that wasn&#39;t mapped. In another case, internal state would be insufficiently updated, preventing safe recovery from the error. This affects drivers/block/xen-blkback/blkback.c. [CVE-2021-26930]\n\n12) Block, net, and SCSI backends consider certain errors a plain bug, deliberately causing a kernel crash. For errors potentially being at least under the influence of guests (such as out of memory conditions), it isn&#39;t correct to assume a plain bug. Memory allocations potentially causing such crashes occur only when Linux is running in PV mode, though. This affects drivers/block/xen-blkback/blkback.c and drivers/xen/xen-scsiback.c. [CVE-2021-26931]\n\n13) Grant mapping operations often occur in batch hypercalls, where a number of operations are done in a single hypercall, the success or failure of each one is reported to the backend driver, and the backend driver then loops over the results, performing follow-up actions based on the success or failure of each operation. Unfortunately, when running in PV mode, the Linux backend drivers mishandle this: Some errors are ignored, effectively implying their success from the success of related batch elements. In other cases, errors resulting from one batch element lead to further batch elements not being inspected, and hence successful ones to not be possible to properly unmap upon error recovery. Only systems with Linux backends running in PV mode are vulnerable. Linux backends run in HVM / PVH modes are not vulnerable. This affects arch/*/xen/p2m.c and drivers/xen/gntdev.c. [CVE-2021-26932]\n\n14) Linux Kernel could allow a local authenticated attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by a kernel pointer leak when show_transport_handle function in drivers/scsi/scsi_transport_iscsi.c is called. By sending a specially-crafted request, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to obtain the address of the iscsi_transport structure information, and use this information to launch further attacks against the affected system. [CVE-2021-27363]\n\n15) Linux Kernel could allow a local authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the system, caused by a vulnerability in the iscsi_if_recv_msg function in drivers/scsi/scsi_transport_iscsi.c. By sending specially-crafted Netlink messages, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to connect to the iscsi NETLINK socket and send arbitrary commands to the kernel. [CVE-2021-27364]\n\n16) Linux Kernel could allow a local authenticated attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by an issue when certain iSCSI data structures do not have appropriate length constraints or checks, and can exceed the PAGE_SIZE value. By sending a specially-crafted Netlink message, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to obtain memory information, and use this information to launch further attacks against the affected system. [CVE-2021-27365]\n\n17) The Xen netback driver lacks necessary treatment of errors such as failed memory allocations (as a result of changes to the handling of grant mapping errors). A host OS denial of service may occur during misbehavior of a networking frontend driver. [CVE-2021-28038]\n\n18) With CONFIG_XEN_BALLOON_MEMORY_HOTPLUG disabled and CONFIG_XEN_UNPOPULATED_ALLOC enabled the Linux kernel will use guest physical addresses allocated via the ZONE_DEVICE functionality for mapping foreign guest&#39;s pages. This will result in problems, as the p2m list will only cover the initial memory size of the domain plus some padding at the end. Most ZONE_DEVICE allocated addresses will be outside the p2m range and thus a mapping can&#39;t be established with those memory addresses, resulting in a crash. The attack involves doing I/O requiring large amounts of data to be mapped by the Dom0 or driver domain. The amount of data needed to result in a crash can vary depending on the memory layout of the affected Dom0 or driver domain. [CVE-2021-28039]\n\n19) Fastrpc_internal_invoke in drivers/misc/fastrpc.c does not prevent user applications from sending kernel RPC messages. [CVE-2021-28375]\n\n20) The rtw_wx_set_scan driver allows writing beyond the end of the -&gt;ssid[] array. [CVE-2021-28660]\n\n21) The fix for XSA-365 includes initialization of pointers such that subsequent cleanup code wouldn&#39;t use uninitialized or stale values. This initialization went too far and may under certain conditions also overwrite pointers which are in need of cleaning up. The lack of cleanup would result in leaking persistent grants. The leak in turn would prevent fully cleaning up after a respective guest has died, leaving around zombie domains. [CVE-2021-28688]\n\n22) A vulnerability was discovered in fs/fuse/fuse_i.h in the Linux kernel. A &quot;stall on CPU&quot; can occur because a retry loop continually finds the same bad inode. [CVE-2021-28950]\n\n23) In the Linux kernel, attackers are able to cause a denial of service (deadlock) because exit may be waiting to park a SQPOLL thread, but concurrently that SQPOLL thread is waiting for a signal to start. [CVE-2021-28951]\n\n24) The sound/soc/qcom/sdm845.c soundwire device driver has a buffer overflow when an unexpected port ID number is encountered. [CVE-2021-28952]\n\n25) A race condition vulnerability in get_old_root in fs/btrfs/ctree.c in the btrfs file-system allows a local attacker with a special user privilege to cause a denial of service due to not locking an extent buffer before a cloning operation. [CVE-2021-28964]\n\n26) In intel_pmu_drain_pebs_nhm in arch/x86/events/intel/ds.c in the Linux kernel on some Haswell CPUs, userspace applications (such as perf-fuzzer) can cause a system crash because the PEBS status in a PEBS record is mishandled. [CVE-2021-28971]\n\n27) The RPA PCI Hotplug driver implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle device name writes via sysfs, leading to a buffer overflow. A privileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. [CVE-2021-28972]\n\n28) BPF JIT compiler for x86 in the Linux kernel did not properly validate computation of branch displacements in some situations allowing a local attacker to use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. [CVE-2021-29154]\n\n29) The Freescale Gianfar Ethernet driver allows attackers to cause a system crash due to a negative fragment size calculated in situations involving an RX queue overrun when jumbo packets are used and NAPI is enabled. [CVE-2021-29264]\n\n30) usbip_sockfd_store in drivers/usb/usbip/stub_dev.c allows attackers to cause a denial of service (GPF) because the stub-up sequence has race conditions during an update of the local and shared status. [CVE-2021-29265]\n\n31) In the vDPA backend virtio driver, an invalid value upon reopening a character device can cause a use-after-free memory corruption. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. [CVE-2021-29266]\n\n32) The TIPC protocol implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate passed encryption key sizes. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). [CVE-2021-29646]\n\n33) qrtr_recvmsg in net/qrtr/qrtr.c allows attackers to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory because of a partially uninitialized data structure. [CVE-2021-29647]\n\n34) The BPF subsystem does not properly consider that resolved_ids and resolved_sizes are intentionally uninitialized in the vmlinux BPF Type Format (BTF), which can cause a system crash upon an unexpected access attempt (in map_create in kernel/bpf/syscall.c or check_btf_info in kernel/bpf/verifier.c) [CVE-2021-29648]\n\n35) In the Linux kernel, the user mode driver (UMD) has a copy_process() memory leak, related to a lack of cleanup steps in kernel/usermode_driver.c and kernel/bpf/preload/bpf_preload_kern.c. [CVE-2021-29649]\n\n36) A denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability was identified in the Linux kernel. The netfilter subsystem allows attackers to cause a denial of service (panic) because net/netfilter/x_tables.c and include/linux/netfilter/x_tables.h lack a full memory barrier upon the assignment of a new table value. [CVE-2021-29650]\n\n37) A vulnerability memory leak in the Linux kernel webcam device functionality in the way user calls ioctl that triggers video_usercopy function. [CVE-2021-30002]\n\n38) An out-of-bounds write vulnerability in the Linux kernel\u2019s console driver functionality in the way a user triggers the ioctl PIO_FONT with malicious data. This vulnerability allows a local user to crash or potentially escalate their privileges on the system. [CVE-2021-33656]\n\n39) The bpf verifier in the Linux kernel did not properly handle mod32 destination register truncation when the source register was known to be 0. A local attacker with the ability to load bpf programs could use this gain out-of-bounds reads in kernel memory leading to information disclosure (kernel memory), and possibly out-of-bounds writes that could potentially lead to code execution. [CVE-2021-3444]\n\n40) This vulnerability allows a device to be inserted twice into a doubly-linked list, leading to a use-after-free when one of these devices is removed. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. [CVE-2021-3483]\n\n41) In __configfs_open_file of file.c, there is a possible use-after-free due to improper locking. This could lead to local escalation of privilege in the kernel with System execution privileges needed. [CVE-2021-39656]\n\n42) A use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel\u2019s io_uring subsystem in the way a user sets up a ring with IORING_SETUP_IOPOLL with more than one task completing submissions on this ring. This allows a local user to crash or escalate their privileges on the system. [CVE-2022-1786]\n\n43) An uncontrolled resource consumption in some Intel Ethernet E810 Adapter drivers for Linux may allow an authenticated user to potentially cause a denial of service via local access. [CVE-2020-24504]\n\n44) NULL pointer dereference in the Linux kernel&#39;s GPU Nouveau driver functionality, in the way the user calls ioctl DRM_IOCTL_NOUVEAU_CHANNEL_ALLOC, allows a local user to crash the system. [CVE-2020-25639]\n\n45) Linux Kernel could allow a local authenticated attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by an out-of-bounds loads vulnerability. By executing specially-crafted BPF programs, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to obtain contents of kernel memory, and use this information to launch further attacks against the affected system. [CVE-2020-27170]\n\n46) kernel/bpf/verifier.c in the Linux kernel has an off-by-one error (with a resultant integer underflow) affecting out-of-bounds speculation on pointer arithmetic, leading to side-channel attacks that defeat Spectre mitigations and obtain sensitive information from kernel memory. [CVE-2020-27171]\n\n47) Use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel through io_uring and the IORING_OP_SPLICE operation. If IORING_OP_SPLICE is missing the IO_WQ_WORK_FILES flag, which signals that the operation won&#39;t use current-&gt;nsproxy, so its reference counter is not increased. This assumption is not always true as calling io_splice on specific files will call the get_uts function which will use current-&gt;nsproxy leading to invalidly decreasing its reference counter later causing the use-after-free vulnerability. [CVE-2022-4696]\n\n48) Due to a vulnerability in the io_uring subsystem, it is possible to leak kernel memory information to the user process. timens_install calls current_is_single_threaded to determine if the current process is single-threaded, but this call does not consider io_uring&#39;s io_worker threads, thus it is possible to insert a time namespace&#39;s vvar page to process&#39;s memory space via a page fault. When this time namespace is destroyed, the vvar page is also freed, but not removed from the process&#39; memory, and a next page allocated by the kernel will be still available from the user-space process and can leak memory contents via this (read-only) use-after-free vulnerability. [CVE-2023-23586]\n\n49) A time-of-check to time-of-use vulnerability exists in io_uring subsystem&#39;s IORING_OP_CLOSE operation in the Linux kernel&#39;s, which allows a local user to elevate their privileges to root. [CVE-2023-1295]\n\n50) The PCI code will call the IRQ mapping function whenever a PCI driver is probed. If these are marked as __init, this causes an oops if a PCI driver is loaded or bound after the kernel has initialised. [CVE-2021-46909]\n\n51) x86/xen: USERGS_SYSRET64 is used to return from a syscall via SYSRET, but a Xen PV guest will nevertheless use the IRET hypercall, as there is no sysret PV hypercall defined.

    "description": "1) Use-after-free in the Sun keyboard driver implementation in the Linux kernel. [CVE-2020-25669]\n\n2) A vulnerability in the JFS filesystem code allowing a local attacker with the ability to set extended attributes to cause a denial of service. [CVE-2020-27815]\n\n3) NULL-ptr dereference in the spk_ttyio_receive_buf2() function in spk_ttyio.c. [CVE-2020-27830]\n\n4) An issue in drivers/accessibility/speakup/spk_ttyio.c in the Linux kernel allows local attackers on systems with the speakup driver could cause a local denial of service attack. This occurs because of an invalid free when the line discipline is used more than once. [CVE-2020-28941]\n\n5) In mm/gup.c and mm/huge_memory.c, the get_user_pages (aka gup) implementation, when used for a copy-on-write page, does not properly consider the semantics of read operations and therefore can grant unintended write access. [CVE-2020-29374]\n\n6) Some OSes are processing watch events using a single thread. If the events are received faster than the thread is able to handle, they will get queued. As the queue is unbounded, a guest may be able to trigger an OOM in the backend. [CVE-2020-29568]\n\n7) An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel, as used with Xen. The Linux kernel PV block backend expects the kernel thread handler to reset ring-&gt;xenblkd to NULL when stopped. However, the handler may not have time to run if the frontend quickly toggles between the states connect and disconnect. As a consequence, the block backend may re-use a pointer after it was freed. A misbehaving guest can trigger a dom0 crash by continuously connecting / disconnecting a block frontend. Privilege escalation and information leaks cannot be ruled out. This only affects systems with a Linux blkback. [CVE-2020-29569]\n\n8) A locking inconsistency issue in the tty subsystem of the Linux kernel where drivers/tty/tty_io.c and drivers/tty/tty_jobctrl.c may allow a read-after-free attack against TIOCGSID. [CVE-2020-29660]\n\n9) A locking issue in the tty subsystem of the Linux kernel where drivers/tty/tty_jobctrl.c allows a use-after-free attack against TIOCSPGRP. [CVE-2020-29661]\n\n10) There is a buffer overflow in PyCArg_repr in _ctypes/callproc.c, which may lead to a crash of the application. Certain Python applications that accept floating-point numbers as untrusted input, as demonstrated by a 1e300 argument to c_double.from_param. This occurs because sprintf is used unsafely. [CVE-2021-3177]\n\n11) The Lib/test/multibytecodec_support.py CJK codec tests call eval() on content retrieved via HTTP. [CVE-2020-27619]\n\n12) An integer overflow vulnerability in libtiff that exists in the tif_getimage.c file. This vulnerability allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary code when a user opens a crafted TIFF file. [CVE-2020-35523]\n\n13) A heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability in libtiff in the handling of TIFF images in libtiff&#39;s TIFF2PDF tool. A specially crafted TIFF file can lead to arbitrary code execution. [CVE-2020-35524]\n\n14) Calls to EVP_CipherUpdate, EVP_EncryptUpdate and EVP_DecryptUpdate may overflow the output length argument in some cases where the input length is close to the maximum permissible length for an integer on the platform. In such cases the return value from the function call will be 1 (indicating success), but the output length value will be negative. This could cause applications to behave incorrectly or crash. [CVE-2021-23840]\n\n15) The OpenSSL public API function X509_issuer_and_serial_hash() attempts to create a unique hash value based on the issuer and serial number data contained within an X509 certificate. However it fails to correctly handle any errors that may occur while parsing the issuer field (which might occur if the issuer field is maliciously constructed). This may subsequently result in a NULL pointer deref and a crash leading to a potential denial of service attack. [CVE-2021-23841]\n\n16) The ca-certificates package contained outdated CA certificates. This update refreshes the included certificates to those contained in the 2.46 version of the Mozilla certificate authority bundle.\n\n17) Git incorrectly handled delay-capable clean/smudge filters when being used on case-insensitive filesystems. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to execute arbitrary code. [CVE-2021-21300]\n\n18) NGINX has a buffer overflow for years that exceed four digits, as demonstrated by a file with a modification date in 1969 that causes an integer overflow (or a false modification date far in the future), when encountered by the autoindex module. [CVE-2017-20005]\n\n19) A vulnerability in libX11 that occurs because the functions in src/InitExt.c do not check that the values provided for the Request, Event, or Error IDs are within the bounds of the arrays that those functions write to, using those IDs as array indexes. They trust that they were called with values provided by an Xserver adhering to the bounds specified in the X11 protocol, as all X servers provided by X.Org do. As the protocol only specifies a single byte for these values, an out-of-bounds value provided by a malicious server (or a malicious proxy-in-the-middle) can only overwrite other portions of the Display structure and not write outside the bounds of the Display structure itself, possibly causing the client to crash with this memory corruption. [CVE-2023-3138]\n\n20) schema_element defeats protective search_path changes; certain database calls in PostgreSQL could permit an authed attacker with elevated database-level privileges to execute arbitrary code.

    "description": "1) SpiderMonkey: The type inference system allows the compilation of functions that can cause type confusions between arbitrary objects when compiled through the IonMonkey just-in-time (JIT) compiler and when the constructor function is entered through on-stack replacement (OSR). This allows for possible arbitrary reading and writing of objects during an exploitable crash. [CVE-2019-9791]\n\n2) Python: A stack-based buffer overflow was discovered in the ctypes module provided within Python. Applications that use ctypes without carefully validating the input passed to it may be vulnerable, which would allow an attacker to overflow a buffer on the stack and crash the application. [CVE-2021-3177]\n\n3) Python, Django: The package python/cpython is vulnerable to Web Cache Poisoning via urllib.parse.parse_qsl and urllib.parse.parse_qs by using a vector called parameter cloaking. When the attacker can separate query parameters using a semicolon (;), they can cause a difference in the interpretation of the request between the proxy (running with default configuration) and the server. This can result in malicious requests being cached as completely safe ones, as the proxy would usually not see the semicolon as a separator, and therefore would not include it in a cache key of an unkeyed parameter. [CVE-2021-23336]\n\n4) Django: The &quot;django.utils.archive.extract()&quot; function, used by &quot;startapp --template&quot; and &quot;startproject --template&quot;, allowed directory-traversal via an archive with absolute paths or relative paths with dot segments. [CVE-2021-3281]\n\n5) WebKitGTK: A code execution vulnerability exists in the AudioSourceProviderGStreamer functionality of Webkit WebKitGTK. A specially crafted web page can lead to a use after free. [CVE-2020-13558]\n\n6) PEAR: Archive_Tar allows an unserialization attack because phar: is blocked but PHAR: is not blocked. [CVE-2020-28948]\n\n7) GLib: GNOME GLib has an integer overflow, that might lead to an out-of-bounds write, in g_option_group_add_entries.

[CVE-2021-27218]\n\n9) Privoxy: Memory leaks in the show-status CGI handler when memory allocations fail can lead to a system crash. [CVE-2021-20215]\n\n10) Privoxy: An assertion failure could be triggered with a crafted CGI request leading to server crash. [CVE-2021-20272]\n\n11) Node.js: Node.js is vulnerable to a use-after-free bug in its TLS implementation. When writing to a TLS enabled socket, node::StreamBase::Write calls node::TLSWrap::DoWrite with a freshly allocated WriteWrap object as first argument. If the DoWrite method does not return an error, this object is passed back to the caller as part of a StreamWriteResult structure. [CVE-2020-8265]\n\n12) Node.js: The Node.js inspector is vulnerable to a DNS rebinding attack which could be exploited to perform remote code execution. An attack is possible from malicious websites open in a web browser on the same computer, or another computer with network access to the computer running the Node.js process. A malicious website could use a DNS rebinding attack to trick the web browser to bypass same-origin-policy checks and to allow HTTP connections to localhost or to hosts on the local network. If a Node.js process with the debug port active is running on localhost or on a host on the local network, the malicious website could connect to it as a debugger, and get full code execution access. [CVE-2018-7160]\n\n13) Wireshark: Memory leak in USB HID dissector in Wireshark allows denial of service via packet injection or crafted capture file. [CVE-2021-22173]\n\n14) Wireshark: Improper URL handling in Wireshark could allow remote code execution via packet injection or crafted capture file. [CVE-2021-22191]\n\n15) OpenLDAP: An assertion failure in slapd can occur in the issuerAndThisUpdateCheck function via a crafted packet, resulting in a denial of service (daemon exit) via a short timestamp. This is related to schema_init.c and checkTime. [CVE-2021-27212]\n\n16) Firefox, Thunderbird: Several memory safety bugs were reported in Firefox. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. [CVE-2021-23987]\n\n17) Apache Tomcat: When responding to new h2c connection requests, Apache Tomcat could duplicate request headers and a limited amount of request body from one request to another meaning user A and user B could both see the results of user A&#39;s request. [CVE-2021-25122]\n\n18) Vulnerability in the MySQL Client product of Oracle MySQL (component: C API).

UI thread of the server can spend an indefinite amount of time (depending on the input) matching this email address to a validation pattern. By repeating this action the attacker may cause thread pool or resource exhaustion, thus making the application unresponsive for normal users.

The token checking implementation was subject to the theoretical possibility of timing attacks based on how long it takes for a request with invalid token to be rejected. These timing attacks could result in exposure of the user&#39;s token, which can be used to blindly submit data on the user&#39;s behalf, without the possibility of reading back the responses, or of opening websockets and listening for published data from the server for that user, which may or may not contain sensitive information due to the application\u2019s nature.

[CVE-2020-13529]\n\n2) The systemd package does not adequately block local privilege escalation for some Sudo configurations, for example, plausible sudoers files, in which the &quot;systemctl status&quot; command may be executed. Specifically, systemd does not set LESSSECURE to 1, and thus other programs may be launched from the less privileged program. This presents a substantial security risk when running systemctl from Sudo because less privilege programs execute as root when the terminal size is too small to show the complete systemctl output.

    "description": "1) An attacker can read arbitrary &#39;.md&#39; files from the server&#39;s filesystem due to an improper input validation, which results in the ability to perform a relative path traversal. The attack works due the fact that the internal router passes the url-encoded alias to the &#39;noteController.showNote&#39;-function. This function passes the input directly to findNote() utility function, that will pass it on the the parseNoteId()-function, that tries to make sense out of the noteId/alias and check if a note already exists and if so, if a corresponding file on disk was updated. If no note exists the note creation-function is called, which pass this unvalidated alias, with a `.md` appended, into a path.join()-function which is read from the filesystem in the follow up routine and provides the pre-filled content of the new note. This allows an attacker to not only read arbitrary &#39;.md&#39; files from the filesystem, but also observes changes to them. The usefulness of this attack can be considered limited, since mainly markdown files are use the file-ending &#39;.md&#39; and all markdown files contained in the hedgedoc project, like the README, are public anyway. If other protections such as a chroot or container or proper file permissions are in place, this attack&#39;s usefulness is rather limited. On a reverse-proxy level one can force a URL-decode, which will prevent this attack because the router will not accept such a path. [CVE-2021-29474]\n\nAdditionally, the following vulnerability has been fixed in version 1.5.0:\n\n2) An attacker is able to receive arbitrary files from the file system when exporting a note to PDF. Since the code injection has to take place as note content, there fore this exploit requires the attackers ability to modify a note. This works because while PhantomJS doesn&#39;t actually render the file:/// references to the PDF file itself, it still uses them internally, and exfiltration is possible, and easy through JavaScript rendering.
